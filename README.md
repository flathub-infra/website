# flathub.org

This is the source code for the website, both backend and frontend. That's running on https://beta.flathub.org and hopefully soon https://flathub.org

# Code contribution

First of all thanks for considering contributing to this project!

Pull request are welcome. Please, create an issue first explaining what you want to do and how.

### Development

You'll need git, yarn, docker and docker-compose.

Go to the folder where you manage your projects and checkout this project.

Then start the backend:

```sh
cd backend
docker-compose up
```

You might need to use `--build` to rebuid the images, when dependencies change.

Use another terminal session to run the following or use your browser to go to localhost:8000/docs and use the UI to run the `/update` endpoint.
This will populate the database with the latest data from the flathub.

```sh
curl -X POST localhost:8000/update
```

Then open a terminal and go the the frontend folder.
If it's the first time you run it, run

```sh
yarn
```

Then you should be able to start the dev server and see changed to the code:

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Storybook

You can also start the storybook via:

```sh
yarn storybook
```

## More backend instructions

You can find more backend instructions in the readme in the backend folder.

## Translations

We're using [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/flathub/) to translate the UI. So feel free, to contribute translations over there.

## Stripe payment testing

In both staging and development environments, Stripe is running in test mode (all data is fake).
To test payment, card details can be used from https://stripe.com/docs/testing.
